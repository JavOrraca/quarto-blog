The guy is a beast!\n\nIf you are familiar with Shiny but want to gain some expert level Shiny skills, this class is for you. Great job with everything that you're doing Matt and I'm excited to release your episode in a few days!\n\nLinks:\n\n* Business Science's [Expert Shiny Developer with AWS](https://university.business-science.io/p/expert-shiny-developer-with-aws-course-ds4b-202a-r/)\n* 15% off Business Science 4-course R bundle [for Scatter Podcast listeners](https://university.business-science.io/p/4-course-bundle-machine-learning-and-web-applications-r-track-101-102-201-202a/?coupon_code=scatterpodcast)\n* Scatter Podcast [Episode 25 w/ Matt Dancho](https://www.javierorraca.com/scatterpodcast/)",
