Check out the `rsthemes` package by [Garrick Aden-Buie](https://www.linkedin.com/in/garrick-aden-buie/) to explore and apply different themes. For the last year or so, I've been enjoying the \"base16 Ashes\" theme at work and home. I prefer the \"One Dark\" theme on Atom / Juno for my Julia setup, But I'm starting to feel like I should use \"One Dark\" across the board. ðŸ¤“\n\nThis package is not yet on CRAN, so you'll have to install via `devtools::install_github()`. See installation and usage code below, pulled from the `rsthemes` GitHub:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n## INSTALLATION\n# Instructions assume devtools is installed)\ndevtools::install_github(\"gadenbuie/rsthemes\")\n\n# Install custom themes + additional set of base16-based themes\nrsthemes::install_rsthemes(include_base16 = TRUE)\n\n## USAGE\n# list installed themes\nrsthemes::list_rsthemes()\n\n# Try all themes\nrsthemes::try_rsthemes()\n\n# Try just the light, dark, or base16 themes, e.g.\nrsthemes::try_rsthemes(\"light\")\n\n# Use a theme\nrstudioapi::applyTheme(\"One Dark {rsthemes}\")\n```\n:::\n\n\nSource:\n\n* [rsthemes on GitHub](https://github.com/gadenbuie/rsthemes)\n\n* [base16 themes](http://chriskempson.com/projects/base16/) ",
