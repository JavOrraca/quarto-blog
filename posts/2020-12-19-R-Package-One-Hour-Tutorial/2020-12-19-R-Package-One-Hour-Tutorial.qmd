Package development should be on every R programmer's radar in 2021, especially with all the free information available online! Here's an excellent, concise, ultra-bookmark-worthy tutorial by Shannon Pileggi, PhD, titled "Your first R package in 1 hour". Folks, she wasn't lying either. I followed her tutorial and built an R package in roughly 45 minutes (note: I assume you have experience with the R language and understand the basics of `devtools`, `usethis`, `roxygen2`, and `rmarkdown`).

Using functions from just the `devtools` and `usethis` packages, the whole process is much more streamlined than what I would have thought. Check out the rest of Shannon's _Piping Hot Data_ website as well...  It's a great resource for R programmers and researchers, and she built it with the newly reintroduced `distill` package, just like this site. :-)
