Holiday expectation: Going to finish a few books, an online class that's been lingering, research...

Holiday reality: Make a million espressos, eat loads of chocolate and cake, play more 'The Legend of Zelda: Link's Awakening' than I thought was humanly possible...

Life is good folks, Merry Christmas and I hope that you got to enjoy some time with family and friends this holiday season!
