# Background

I've been attending Posit's weekly [Data Science Hangout](https://posit.co/data-science-hangout/) since 2021 and it's been one of my favorite standing weekly meetings. This is a great platform to hear how data science leaders are using R to drive business results and the host, Rachael Dempsey, does an excellent job fostering an inclusive and open culture. I was thrilled to be the guest several weeks ago in Dec 2022. ðŸš€

I talked about my transition to data science from a career in financial modeling and consulting, talked about my love for Shiny and the R community, and gave some tips on how to start your own data science community. I also said "you know" an inordinate number of times, please forgive me in advance. ðŸ™ƒ  

Whether you're a data science practitioner, student, looking to make a career pivot, or simply wanting to network, the Data Science Hangout has something for all. If you haven't already, I highly encourage you to attend Posit's Data Science Hangout live sometime in the future.
