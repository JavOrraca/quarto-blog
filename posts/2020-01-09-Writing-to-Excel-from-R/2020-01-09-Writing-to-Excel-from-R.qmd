`openxlsx` is an awesome package for writing multiple datasets to multiple sheets of an Excel workbook, and allows for robust styling and cell formatting. I found a tutorial on RPubs written by [Ezekiel Adebayo Ogundepo](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ezekiel-ogundepo/) covering this package that I often use at work. Definitely bookmark worthy.

Here is a high-level code example:
```r
library(openxlsx)

# Name the Excel worksheets where you want to export data to
list_of_datasets <- list("Overall Summary" = df_1, "LOB Summary" = df_2, "Details" = df_3)

# Save the Excel workbook to your wd with your worksheet list and name the Excel file
write.xlsx(list_of_datasets, "Excel_Workbook_2017.01.20.xlsx")
```
