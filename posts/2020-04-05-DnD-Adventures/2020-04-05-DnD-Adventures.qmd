Wizards of the Coast have developed such an incredible tabletop, fantasy, RPG with the 5th edition of D&D... I wish I would have re-discovered this game years back. For context, I haven't touched D&D since 1997!

If you know of good resources for newbies and new D&D Dungeon Masters ("DMs"), I'd love to know about your favorite resources. For data science folks out there, this site was built with R using `blogdown`, Hugo themes, and deployed for free using GitHub and Netlify.
