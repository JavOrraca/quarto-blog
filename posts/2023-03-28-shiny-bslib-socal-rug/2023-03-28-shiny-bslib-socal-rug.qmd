# Background

The Southern California R Users Group ("SoCal RUG") is one of my favorite organizations - Not only is there a lot to be learned from regularly attending our events, it's a great place to meet and network with other passionate data scientists in the community.

Last week, I presented to SoCal RUG on how to build a Shiny app demo as a resume or cover letter accessory, an extension to the [_Build a Shiny App Demo_](https://www.javierorracadeatcu.com/posts/2022-11-15-shiny-bslib-demo/2022-11-15-shiny-bslib-demo.html) blog post that I wrote in Nov 2022. Empowering yourself with this kind of 'accessory' ready to be demoed at your interviews will help impress data science hiring managers and also differentiate you from other applicants.
