Torch for R... wow! ðŸ”¥ðŸ”¥ðŸ”¥ I was recently having a discussion with a coworker about the benefits of Torch, especially the power of training one global model capable of hierarchical projections (awesome for time series) and predicting multiple group-specific regressions. I went down a Googling rabbit hole last weekend and came across some amazing articles by Sigrid Keydana (see links below) introducing `torch` to the R community and also recently releasing `luz`, a high-level R interface to Torch ("`luz` is to `torch` what `Keras` is to `TensorFlow`").

RStudio's MLVerse team is doing really exciting things for the R machine learning and AI community. With `torch`, I no longer need to launch a conda environment for complex NNs (although having Python on your system is always handy ðŸ˜…). And even better, "`torch` for R is built directly on top of `libtorch`, a C++ library that provides the tensor-computation and automatic-differentiation capabilities essential to building neural networks." If you're looking for fast NNs and deep learning solutions within the **#rstats** framework, give these packages a try. Happy Friday and happy learning! ðŸ¤“ðŸ“š
