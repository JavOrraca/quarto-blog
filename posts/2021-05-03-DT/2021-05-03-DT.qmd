The [DT package](https://rstudio.github.io/DT/) for R is a powerful integration of the JavaScript library _DataTables_. One of the things that I enjoy with `DT` is enhancing my Shiny apps by rendering interactive tables with `DT`. The `DT` documentation, written by [RStudio PBC](https://www.rstudio.com/) and the `DT` devs, is incredibly well-written and you'll learn a lot about how you can use these tables in the development of robust R web apps. And the available Options.... Endless in a good way!

If you're a Shiny dev, check out the live demos sourced below.
