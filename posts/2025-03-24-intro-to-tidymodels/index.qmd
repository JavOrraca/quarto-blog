# About Tidymodels

The [tidymodels](https://tidymodels.org/) framework for R is a collection of packages that brings tidy principles and a unified syntax to machine learning ("ML") for R programmers, enabling end-to-end reproducibility for your ML workflows. I've been using this framework for five years and it continues to improve. Posit PBC funds a software engineering team dedicated to the development of this framework so its packages are feature-rich, regularly maintained, and current with ML trends. For Python users unfamiliar with R tools, the `tidymodels` framework is very similar to Python's `scikit-learn`.

The core `tidymodels` packages include the following:

* [rsample](https://rsample.tidymodels.org/): provides infrastructure for efficient data splitting and resampling

* [parsnip](https://parsnip.tidymodels.org/): a tidy, unified interface to models that can be used to try a range of models without getting bogged down in the syntactical minutiae of the underlying packages

* [recipes](https://recipes.tidymodels.org/): a tidy interface to data pre-processing tools for feature engineering

* [workflows](https://workflows.tidymodels.org/): expands the traditional model-only recipe to a much more holistic blueprint for pre-processing, modeling, post-processing, and evaluation

* [dials](https://dials.tidymodels.org/): creates and manages tuning parameters and parameter grids

* [tune](https://tune.tidymodels.org/): helps you optimize the hyperparameters of your model and pre-processing steps

* [yardstick](https://yardstick.tidymodels.org/): measures the effectiveness of models using performance metrics

* [broom](https://broom.tidymodels.org/): converts the information in common statistical R objects into user-friendly, predictable formats

I was thrilled to present about `tidymodels` last week to the _Department of Mathematics, Statistics and Data Science_ at Loyola Marymount University. Their students and faculty were engaging and I had a great time covering a logistic regression problem with this framework.
