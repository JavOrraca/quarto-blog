# Doing More with Less

Ever wonder how you can work with "bigger than RAM" datasets on your laptopâ€™s memory without needing a supercomputer? Last night, I had a great time presenting a practical approach to modern data science tooling that is reshaping how data is processed, analyzed, and presented, all from your local machine.

I shared how language-agnostic, open-source data storage and processing frameworks like Apache Parquet, Apache Arrow, DuckDB, and Polars make it possible to handle enormous data efficiently, whether youâ€™re working with SQL, R, Python, and more. These next-gen frameworks let you process huge datasets faster than ever, right on your laptop. For example, I live-demoed how I'm able to read a 1.1 billion row, 22 column, 40GB data set on my MacBook Air in _25 milliseconds_. ðŸš€

# Other Tools Explored

- [Positron](https://positron.posit.co/): A fresh, open-source coding environment purpose-built for data analysis and modeling, including all the best bells and whistles from VS Code and RStudio.
- [Quarto](https://quarto.org/): An open source technical publishing system similar in feel to notebooks (like Jupyter Notebooks) for creating beautiful articles, websites, slides, dashboards, and with full support for Python, R, Julia, and Observable
