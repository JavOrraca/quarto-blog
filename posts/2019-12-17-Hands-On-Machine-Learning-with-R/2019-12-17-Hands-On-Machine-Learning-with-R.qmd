I am super excited to finally dig into Hands-On Machine Learning with R by [Brad Boehmke, Ph.D.](https://www.linkedin.com/in/brad-boehmke-ph-d-9b0a257/) and [Brandon Greenwell](https://www.linkedin.com/in/brandon-greenwell-90310b94/).

There are a ton of solid ML books on the market for Python and R users but I've struggled with developing a best practice ML workflow to make maintainable code and to enhance my sampling, evaluation, and iteration process. As an R user, I'm glad to have this hands-on approach resource to improve my use of the ML stack within R.
