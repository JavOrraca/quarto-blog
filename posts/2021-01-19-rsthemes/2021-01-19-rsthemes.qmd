Feel like freshening up your RStudio IDE? Check out the `rsthemes` package by [Garrick Aden-Buie](https://www.linkedin.com/in/garrick-aden-buie/) to explore and apply different themes. For the last year or so, I've been enjoying the "base16 Ashes" theme at work and home. I prefer the "One Dark" theme on Atom / Juno for my Julia setup, But I'm starting to feel like I should use "One Dark" across the board. ðŸ¤“

This package is not yet on CRAN, so you'll have to install via `devtools::install_github()`. See installation and usage code below, pulled from the `rsthemes` GitHub:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
## INSTALLATION
# Instructions assume devtools is installed)
devtools::install_github("gadenbuie/rsthemes")

# Install custom themes + additional set of base16-based themes
rsthemes::install_rsthemes(include_base16 = TRUE)

## USAGE
# list installed themes
rsthemes::list_rsthemes()

# Try all themes
rsthemes::try_rsthemes()

# Try just the light, dark, or base16 themes, e.g.
rsthemes::try_rsthemes("light")

# Use a theme
rstudioapi::applyTheme("One Dark {rsthemes}")
```
