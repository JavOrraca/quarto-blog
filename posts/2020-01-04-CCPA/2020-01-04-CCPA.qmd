The California Consumer Privacy Act ("CCPA") data rights include, but are not limited to, the following:

-   the right to know,
-   the right to delete,
-   the right to opt-out of personal data sale, and
-   the right to non-discrimination when a consumer exercises a privacy right under CCPA.

CCPA will only apply to businesses that meet one or more of these three criteria:

1)  have annual revenues greater than \$25 million USD,
2)  businesses that buy / receive / sell personal information of 50k+ consumers, or
3)  businesses that derive 50% or more of annual revenues from selling consumers' personal information

CCPA exempt businesses include HIPAA-compliant health insurers and providers, certain financial institutions, and credit reporting agencies.

The expected fine per unintentional and intentional violation is \$2,500 and \$7,500, respectively. Fines make sense, but I hope that the California Department of Justice can establish clear reporting and audit requirements to enforce these new regulations.
