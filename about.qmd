My name is Javier Orraca and I'm a data scientist. I enjoy building predictive models, developing web applications, cooking, reading, and playing board games. For a living, I get to solve puzzles with data - Life is good.

## Professional

My career includes over 15 years of data science, financial strategy, and business analytics for EY, PG&E, KPMG, Health Net, and [Bloomreach](https://bloomreach.com/). At Bloomreach, my team applies data science techniques to empower decision makers with descriptive and prescriptive analytics. I help our business develop and deploy automation solutions, predictive algorithms, and interactive web apps for our internal leaders, Operations, Product, Marketing, and Sales teams.

## Scatter Podcast

In 2019, I launched [Scatter Podcast](https://soundcloud.com/scatterpodcast) to share career tips and insights from data science leaders for students, business managers, and professionals looking to pivot into data science. It was a fun and incredibly rewarding side project but after 30 episodes, I started to feel fatigued with the amount of time it took to plan, record, edit, market, etc. The podcast is on hold *but not dead!*

## Full Stack Web Development

While not my primary professional focus, I am a proficient full stack web developer leveraging the R programming language and RStudio ecosystem. I develop and deploy client and server software including websites, APIs, and interactive web applications. For interactive, enterprise-grade web apps, [R Shiny](https://shiny.rstudio.com/) is my framework of choice.

Shiny allows me to build apps with clean UIs, advanced [modules](https://mastering-shiny.org/scaling-modules.html#scaling-modules), and I can easily inject [HTML](https://shiny.rstudio.com/articles/tag-glossary.html), [CSS](https://engineering-shiny.org/css.html), and [JavaScript](https://deanattali.com/shinyjs/) for front-end customization. Recently, I've been learning the [Julia](https://julialang.org/) programming language and [Genie](https://genieframework.com/) web framework to augment my data science and app development workflows.

This website was built with [Distill](https://rstudio.github.io/distill/), an R web publishing framework that feels intuitive and easy to use if you're already familiar with R Markdown and `blogdown`. I host this site for free on GitHub, deploy using Netlify, and I pay \$15/year for the domain name. Open-source tools are fast, flexible, fun, and the future of data science.
