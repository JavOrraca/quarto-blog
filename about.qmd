## Professional

My career includes over 15 years of data science, financial strategy, and business analytics for EY, PG&E, KPMG, Centene, and Bloomreach. I use the R and Python programming languages on a daily basis but am much more advanced with my R work. My teams apply data science techniques to empower decision makers with descriptive, predictive, and prescriptive analytics. I sit somewhere between the business stakeholder and cloud IT engineering to develop and deploy automation pipelines, predictive models, interactive web apps, and simulations.

## Scatter Podcast

In 2019, I launched [Scatter Podcast](https://soundcloud.com/scatterpodcast) to share career tips and insights from data science leaders for students, business managers, and professionals looking to pivot into data science. It was a fun and incredibly rewarding side project but after 30 episodes, I started to feel fatigued with the amount of time it took to plan, record, edit, market, etc. The podcast is on hold *but not dead!*

## Data Science & Associated Experiences

- **DevOps + MLOps**: GitLab (+ CI/CD), GitHub (+ Actions/Workflows), Databricks (+ MLFlow), Docker, Posit Connect, Kubernetes, Rancher, Ubuntu, Bash
- **Data**: Snowflake, Teradata, Apache Arrow, Apache Parquet, DuckDB, AWS S3, AWS Redshift, NetApp StorageGRID, Google BigQuery
- **Other**: Python (I'm objectively terrible but w/ ChatGPT I've been known to impress myself and my team üèÜ), Jupyter Notebooks, Agile Scrum (+ the tools that surround it, e.g., Jira, ServiceNow, Miro, etc.), Netlify
