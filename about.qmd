## Professional

Iâ€™m a data scientist and AI leader with 20 years of hands-on and executive experience at EY, PG&E, KPMG, Bloomreach, and Centene. My teams turn raw data into production-grade AI systems, deploying end-to-end ETL and inference pipelines, simulations and predictive models, interactive web apps, and low-latency APIs that steer strategy for Medicare, Medicaid, and Marketplace programs.

Beyond the day job, I chair the Southern California R Users Group (SoCal RUG), a nonprofit that hosts monthly meetups on R, Python, Julia, and all things data science. SoCal RUG also partners with the University of California and Chapman University to deliver SQL/R/Python bootcamps, git workshops, and hackathon support to data science graduate programs.
