## Professional

My career includes over 15 years of data science, financial strategy, and business analytics for EY, PG&E, KPMG, Centene, and Bloomreach. I use the R and Python programming languages on a daily basis but am much more advanced with my R work. My teams apply data science techniques to empower decision makers with descriptive, predictive, and prescriptive analytics. I help bridge the gap between business needs and IT to develop and deploy automation solutions, predictive algorithms, and interactive web apps.

## Scatter Podcast

In 2019, I launched [Scatter Podcast](https://soundcloud.com/scatterpodcast) to share career tips and insights from data science leaders for students, business managers, and professionals looking to pivot into data science. It was a fun and incredibly rewarding side project but after 30 episodes, I started to feel fatigued with the amount of time it took to plan, record, edit, market, etc. The podcast is on hold *but not dead!*
