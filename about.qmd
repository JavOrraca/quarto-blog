## Professional

My career includes 20 years of individual contributor and leadership roles across the spectrum of data science, financial modeling, and business analytics for EY, PG&E, KPMG, Bloomreach, and Centene. I use tools like R, SQL, Python, git, VS Code, RStudio Server, Databricks, and Snowflake on a daily basis. My teams apply analytics and data science techniques to empower decision makers with AI tools and prescriptive business insights. As part of Centene's AI Center of Excellence, I productionize data solutions (automation pipelines, models, web apps, simulation studies, REST APIs, etc.) to support Centene's Quality line of business.
