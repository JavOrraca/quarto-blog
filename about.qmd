My name is Javier Orraca-Deatcu and I'm a data scientist. I enjoy building predictive models, developing web applications, cooking, reading, and playing board games. For a living, I get to solve puzzles with data - Life is good.

## Professional

My career includes over 15 years of data science, financial strategy, and business analytics for EY, PG&E, KPMG, Health Net, and [Bloomreach](https://bloomreach.com/). At Bloomreach, my team applies data science techniques to empower decision makers with descriptive and prescriptive analytics. I help our business develop and deploy automation solutions, predictive algorithms, and interactive web apps for our internal leaders, Operations, Product, Marketing, and Sales teams.

## Scatter Podcast

In 2019, I launched [Scatter Podcast](https://soundcloud.com/scatterpodcast) to share career tips and insights from data science leaders for students, business managers, and professionals looking to pivot into data science. It was a fun and incredibly rewarding side project but after 30 episodes, I started to feel fatigued with the amount of time it took to plan, record, edit, market, etc. The podcast is on hold *but not dead!*
