I'm a data scientist and machine learning engineer with experiences in financial modeling, analytics, interactive visualizations, and predictive modeling. For a living, I get to solve problems with data... **Life is good!**

## Data Science & MLOps

I initially got into data science to advance my financial modeling skills and found myself developing time series forecasting models with algorithms like [XGBoost](https://xgboost.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) and [Prophet](https://facebook.github.io/prophet/). Shortly after pivoting to healthcare insurance, I became enamored with developing ultra-fast, enterprise-grade [Shiny](https://shiny.rstudio.com/) web apps.

Today, I lead machine learning initiatives that enhance healthcare quality and customer experience for over 25 million members. I architect scalable ML solutions, empower junior team members to deliver value-driven software, and equip our data professionals with tutorials and technical documentation.

On any given day, you'll find me working with the [RStudio IDE](https://posit.co/downloads/), [Databricks](https://www.databricks.com/), [Posit Connect](https://posit.co/products/enterprise/connect/), [JupyterHub](https://jupyter.org/hub), [Docker](https://www.docker.com/), [tidymodels](https://www.tidymodels.org/), [Arrow](https://arrow.apache.org/), [DuckDB](https://duckdb.org/), and more.

## Languages

My daily languages include R, Python, SQL, and Bash, but my preferred language is R. I use R for a wide range of work including ML/AI model development, package creation, communication with data warehouses and REST APIs, automation pipelines, interactive apps, and websites (for example, this site was built with R + [Quarto](https://quarto.org/)).

## Data Science Communities

There are a plethora of online and in-person data science communities to learn from and share your own experiences. Online communities for open-source languages and data science are incredibly welcoming and below are my favorites:

- [SoCal R Users Group](https://www.meetup.com/socal-rug/ "SoCal RUG meets on a monthly basis for online and in-person events")
- [Data Science Hangout](https://posit.co/data-science-hangout/ "Data Science Hangout hosted by Posit's Rachael Dempsey, Thursdays at 12pm ET")
- [R-Ladies Global](https://rladies.org/ "R-Ladies Is A World-Wide Organization To Promote Gender Diversity In The R Community")
