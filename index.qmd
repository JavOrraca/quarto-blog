I'm a data scientist and machine learning engineer with experiences in financial modeling, analytics, interactive visualizations, and predictive modeling. For a living, I get to solve problems with data... **Life is good!**

## Data Science & MLOps

I initially got into data science to augment my financial modeling experiences and naturally found myself developing time series regression models with tools like [XGBoost](https://xgboost.readthedocs.io/en/stable/), [Prophet](https://facebook.github.io/prophet/), [TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials/structured_data/time_series), [H2O](https://docs.h2o.ai/h2o/latest-stable/h2o-docs/welcome.html), and more. Shortly after pivoting to healthcare insurance, I became enamored with developing ultra-fast, aesthetically clean, enterprise-grade web apps with R [Shiny](https://shiny.rstudio.com/). Today, I spend most of my time developing classification models that improve healthcare quality for over 25 million individuals. On any given day, you'll likely find me developing models or experimenting with [the RStudio IDE](https://posit.co/downloads/), git [automation](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/), [Quarto](https://quarto.org/), [Databricks](https://www.databricks.com/), [tidymodels](https://www.tidymodels.org/), [Apache Arrow](https://arrow.apache.org/), and [DuckDB](https://duckdb.org/).

## Languages

My daily toolkit includes R, SQL, Python, and Bash. My preferred go-to language is R as I can use it for a wide range of work including: package and ML/AI model development, data warehouse communication (via backend SQL executions), automation pipelines & workflows, web apps, and websites (for example, this site was built with R + [Quarto](https://quarto.org/)).

## Data Science Communities

There are a plethora of online and in-person data science communities to learn from and share your own experiences. Online communities for open-source languages and data science are incredibly welcoming and below are my favorites:

- [SoCal R Users Group](https://www.meetup.com/socal-rug/ "SoCal RUG meets on a monthly basis for online and in-person events")
- [Data Science Hangout](https://www.rstudio.com/data-science-hangout/live-calls/ "Data Science Hangout hosted by RStudio's Rachael Dempsey, Thursdays at 12pm ET")
- [R-Ladies Global](https://rladies.org/ "R-Ladies Is A World-Wide Organization To Promote Gender Diversity In The R Community")
