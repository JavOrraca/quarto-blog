I'm a data scientist with experiences in financial modeling, analytics, and machine learning. For a living, I get to solve problems with data... **Life is good!**

## Programming

I use R to develop and deploy packages, web apps, automation pipelines, machine learning workflows, and websites (this site was built with [Quarto](https://quarto.org/)). My daily toolkit also includes Python but I prefer R.

## Web App Development

My framework of choice for web app development is R + [Shiny](https://shiny.rstudio.com/) . With Shiny, I can build enterprise-grade UIs on top of [Bootstrap 5](https://getbootstrap.com/) that can be infinitely styled with HTML, [Sass](https://sass-lang.com/), CSS, JavaScript, and more.

## Data Science Communities

There are a plethora of online and in-person data science communities to learn from and share your own experiences. Online communities for open-source languages and data science are incredibly welcoming and below are my favorites:

- [SoCal R Users Group](https://www.meetup.com/socal-rug/ "SoCal RUG meets on a monthly basis for online and in-person events")
- [Data Science Hangout](https://www.rstudio.com/data-science-hangout/live-calls/ "Data Science Hangout hosted by RStudio's Rachael Dempsey, Thursdays at 12pm ET")
- [R-Ladies Global](https://rladies.org/ "R-Ladies Is A World-Wide Organization To Promote Gender Diversity In The R Community")
- [The Ravit Show](https://theravitshow.com/ "TRS, hosted by Ravit Jain, is a community for data science & AI practitioners")
