**I get to solve puzzles with data... Life is good!** I'm a data scientist and super passionate about learning and helping others. I have over 15 years of experience in business analytics, financial modeling, web app development, and deploying reproducible machine learning workflows.
<br><br>
I primarily code in R to develop and deploy software including R packages, APIs, interactive web app, and websites (I built this site with [Quarto](https://quarto.org/) for free).
<br><br>
My engine of choice for enterprise-grade web apps is [Shiny](https://shiny.rstudio.com/). Shiny allows me to build clean UIs on top of [Bootstrap 5](https://getbootstrap.com/) and I can easily inject HTML, [Sass](https://sass-lang.com/), CSS, and JavaScript for endless front-end customization.
