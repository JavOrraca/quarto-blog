Hi, I'm Javier! ðŸ‘‹ Iâ€™m a data science leader, open-source evangelist, and GenAI engineer who thrives at the intersection of machine learning, modeling, experimentation, and large-scale AI delivery. **_My North Star is simple: Solve real problems with data and share the playbook._**

## Data Science & MLOps

I first honed my data science skills by enhancing valuation and forecasting models with algos like ARIMA and XGBoost. After moving into health tech, I discovered a passion for building ultra-fast, enterprise-grade Shiny web apps.

Today, I spearhead machine learning and GenAI initiatives at Centene that enhance healthcare quality and customer experience for over 28 million members. I architect scalable ML solutions, empower junior team members to deliver value-driven software, document best practices, and publish packages and tutorials that reach 1,000+ data scientists, analysts, and engineers.

On any given day, youâ€™ll catch me deep in [Databricks](https://www.databricks.com/), [Positron](https://positron.posit.co/) (an OSS VS Code fork), [RStudio IDE](https://posit.co/downloads/), [JupyterHub](https://jupyter.org/hub), [Posit Connect](https://posit.co/products/enterprise/connect/), and the Linux CLI wiring together [Arrow](https://arrow.apache.org/), [DuckDB](https://duckdb.org/), model-serving LLM endpoints, data pipelines, and [Docker](https://www.docker.com/)-ized services.

## Languages

My daily languages include R, Python, SQL, and Bash, but my preferred language is R. I use R for a wide range of work including ML/AI model development, package creation, communication with data warehouses and REST APIs, vector DB + RAG solutions, automation pipelines, interactive apps, and websites (for example, this site was built with R + [Quarto](https://quarto.org/)).

## Data Science Communities

There are a plethora of online and in-person data science communities to learn from and share your own experiences. Online communities for open-source languages and data science are incredibly welcoming and below are my favorites:

- [SoCal R Users Group](https://www.meetup.com/socal-rug/ "SoCal RUG meets on a monthly basis for online and in-person events")
- [Data Science Hangout](https://posit.co/data-science-hangout/ "Data Science Hangout hosted by Posit's Rachael Dempsey, Thursdays at 12pm ET")
- [R-Ladies Global](https://rladies.org/ "R-Ladies Is A World-Wide Organization To Promote Gender Diversity In The R Community")
